% Write a program to demonstrate the DSB-TC AM, i.e. commercial AM implementation for a baseband cosine signal of carrier frequency 15 Hz. 
% Take a carrier signal whose carrier frequency be 30Hz (i.e. fc for multiplier cosine signal in the formula) and amplitude is 8 samples per carrier. 
% Now consider the modulation index to be 0.1 and the carrier amplitude of the proposed AM signal be 1.
% Also consider the baseband and the carrier signal propagates at the rate of 1 milliseconds.
% Now plot the AM signal. Do remember to plot the carrier and the baseband original signal also.

fc = 15
